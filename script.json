    "Tell me more" : "Well, you probably already know the basics.  They're super in love, they're obnoxiously cute, and they're getting married.  What do you want to know about?  %[Tell me about the wedding.](postback:x) %[Tell me about the reception.](postback:x) , or what?",
    "Tell me about the wedding" : "I am SO EXCITED about their wedding!  Or, you know, I would be, if I weren't a bot.\nThe wedding will be on August 21, 2016, at Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York.

    "ELVIS" : "Sorry, we were going to invite her, but she's dressed too formally!",
    "PISA" : "The other love of Arie's life.  Also the best cat in the universe.",
    "What should I wear" : "I hear the bride and groom are going snazzy for the ceremony but semi-formal for the wedding.  How about a suit or cocktail dress?",
